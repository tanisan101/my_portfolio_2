# Netlify 404 Error Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 Step 1: Identify the Root Cause

### A. Check the Exact Error Details
1. **Visit your site**: https://splendid-daffodil-ee0ec0.netlify.app
2. **Document the error**:
   - What URL shows the 404?
   - Is it the main page or a specific route?
   - Does "age not found" appear instead of "Page not found"?

### B. Common 404 Scenarios on Netlify
- **Main page (/) returns 404**: Deployment or build issue
- **Specific routes return 404**: SPA routing problem
- **Assets return 404**: File path or build output issues
- **Partial text "age not found"**: Corrupted HTML or encoding issue

## 🕵️ Step 2: Verify if Page/Resource Previously Existed

### A. Check Netlify Deploy Log
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site: `splendid-daffodil-ee0ec0`
3. Go to **Deploys** tab
4. Click on the latest deploy
5. Check the **Deploy log** for errors

### B. Verify File Structure
```bash
# Expected file structure for your portfolio:
/
├── index.html          ← Main entry point
├── style.css          ← Styles
├── script.js          ← JavaScript
├── firebase-config.js ← Firebase setup
├── package.json       ← Dependencies
└── netlify.toml       ← Netlify configuration
```

### C. Check Build Output
1. In Netlify dashboard → **Site settings** → **Build & deploy**
2. Verify **Publish directory** is set to `.` (root)
3. Check if `index.html` exists in the published files

## ⚙️ Step 3: Check Routing and Redirects Configuration

### A. Review Current netlify.toml
Your previous configuration had a redirect rule that was causing issues:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  conditions = {Role = ["admin"]}  ← This was the problem!
```

**Problem**: The `conditions = {Role = ["admin"]}` meant this redirect only applied to admin users, causing 404s for regular visitors!

### B. Fixed Redirect Rule ✅
The redirect has been updated to work for all users:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## 🔧 Step 4: Review Netlify Deployment Settings

### A. Check Build Settings
1. **Netlify Dashboard** → Your site → **Site settings** → **Build & deploy**
2. Verify these settings:
   - **Repository**: Connected to correct GitHub repo
   - **Base directory**: (leave empty)
   - **Build command**: `echo 'No build step required'`
   - **Publish directory**: `.`

### B. Check Environment Variables
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Ensure no conflicting variables are set
3. Firebase config should be in your code, not environment variables

### C. Verify Deploy Status
1. **Deploys** tab → Latest deploy
2. Status should be **Published** (green)
3. If **Failed**, check the deploy log for errors

## 🛠️ Step 5: Implement the Appropriate Fix

### ✅ Fix Applied: Updated netlify.toml
The main issue was the admin-only redirect condition. This has been fixed by:

1. **Removed admin condition** from the main redirect rule
2. **Added specific file type handling** to prevent assets from being redirected
3. **Maintained security headers** and caching rules

### Additional Fixes to Try:

#### Fix 2: Clear Netlify Cache
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Build & deploy** → **Post processing**
2. Click **Clear cache and deploy site**
3. Wait for new deployment to complete

#### Fix 3: Check File Permissions
Ensure your `index.html` has proper content:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Tanishka - Portfolio</title>
    <!-- ... rest of your head content ... -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your portfolio content -->
</body>
</html>
```

#### Fix 4: Manual Redeploy
1. Make a small change to any file (add a comment)
2. Commit and push to trigger new deployment
3. Monitor the deploy process

## 🧪 Step 6: Testing Your Fixes

### A. Test Main Routes
After the fix is deployed, test these URLs:
- `https://splendid-daffodil-ee0ec0.netlify.app/` (main page)
- `https://splendid-daffodil-ee0ec0.netlify.app/#about` (about section)
- `https://splendid-daffodil-ee0ec0.netlify.app/#contact` (contact section)

### B. Test Asset Loading
Check browser developer tools:
1. Open **Network** tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify all files load with **200** status codes:
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `firebase-config.js`

### C. Test Contact Form
1. Fill out the contact form
2. Submit a test message
3. Check for success notification
4. Verify no JavaScript errors in console

## 🚨 Common Netlify 404 Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Page Not Found" on Main URL
**Cause**: Missing or corrupted `index.html`
**Solution**: Verify `index.html` exists and has valid HTML

### Issue 2: Assets Return 404
**Cause**: Incorrect file paths or build output
**Solution**: Check file paths are relative and files exist

### Issue 3: SPA Routes Return 404
**Cause**: Missing or incorrect redirect rules
**Solution**: Add `/* /index.html 200` redirect rule

### Issue 4: Intermittent 404s
**Cause**: Caching issues or CDN propagation
**Solution**: Clear cache and wait for CDN propagation

### Issue 5: "age not found" (Partial Text)
**Cause**: Corrupted HTML or encoding issues
**Solution**: Check HTML validity and character encoding
